# COME-SIT-
IT INCLUDES A PROJECT REGARDING A WEBSITE
I ADDEED THE FILE WITH THE NAME OF THE WEBSITE WHICH IS PIZZA 
IN THE FILE NAMED PIZZA I NAMED THE WEBSITE PIZZA MANIA
IT INCLUDES THE CODE THAT I HAVE WRITTEN FOR THE MY WEBSITE
YOU CAN RUN IT ON AN ONLINE COMPILER OR NOTEPAD++ ...ANY OTHER SOURCE CODE EDITORS LIKE THIS WOULD WORK
IT IS IN HTML LANGUAGE
SINCE I AM AN ASPIRING PROGRAMMER I DIDNT WRITE ALL BY MYSELF BUT I WATCHED VIDEOS AND BROWSED THE INTERNET FOR THE SAME
I LEARNED A LOT IN THIS EXAM ITSELF BECAUSE I GOT THE CHANCE OF EXPLORING A WHOLE NEW DOMAIN 
I AM VERY GLAD THAT I DIDNT GIVE UP DURING THIS PROCESS LIKE THE OTHER KIDS AND I WENT THROUGH THIS BECAUSE THE LEARNING WERE ENDLESS
I EXPLORED GITHUB,REPOSITORY,GIT ITS FUNCTIONS AND A LOT MANY THINGS LIKE THIS
THIS HAS TAUGHT ME A LOT AND I FIND IT REALLY INTERESTING
SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BE A PART OF RUDRA AND HELP THIS TEAM GROW WITH MY EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE IN RETURN FOR THE SAME THING FROM IT AS WELL
THIS WAS WHOLESOME!
THANKYOU!
